# AA_2025

Welcome to the repository of the course "Analytics and Applications(AA)". We will use this space as the central point for sharing code, data and instructions with you over the course of this semester.

You should check this repo regularly to view and/or download newly released or updated files. If you have experience using git or if you want to learn how to work with a state-of-the-art version control system, you may wish to fork and regularly pull updates to the repository onto your local machine for convenience.

For a complete step-by-step guide on setting up Python, GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks, please refer to the [Setup-folder](Setup/). You should complete all steps before the first workshop session.

A good first stop for all questions that are not subject-related but relate to how to use these kinds of tools you can have a look here (and request new guides by using issue templates): [Teaching Material](https://github.com/IS3UniCologne/teaching-material)
